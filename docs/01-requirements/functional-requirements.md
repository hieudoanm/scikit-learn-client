# Functional Requirements

This document specifies the functional requirements for scikit-learn-client (skl), organised by capability. Each requirement carries a unique ID (`FR-###`), a description, and a priority. IDs are grouped by capability block and are intentionally sparse; gaps are reserved for future requirements within that capability.

## Learning Task Types

skl supports six `taskType` values. The task type determines whether a label column is required, how the data is split, which algorithms are eligible, and which metrics are returned.

| `taskType`              | Supervision     | Label column                                      | Split                                    | Default metrics                                             |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `classification`        | Supervised      | Required; categorical or discrete                 | Hold-out, stratified                     | accuracy, precisionMacro, recallMacro, f1Macro              |
| `regression`            | Supervised      | Required; numeric                                 | Hold-out                                 | rmse, mae, r2                                               |
| `semi_supervised`       | Semi-supervised | Required; empty cells are unlabelled              | Hold-out on labelled rows                | accuracy, precisionMacro, recallMacro, f1Macro + counts     |
| `clustering`            | Unsupervised    | Must be absent                                    | None (fit and score all rows)            | silhouette, daviesBouldin, calinskiHarabasz, inertia or BIC |
| `anomaly_detection`     | Unsupervised    | Must be absent                                    | None (fit and score all rows)            | anomalyCount, anomalyRate, scoreMean, scoreStd              |
| `reinforcement_learning` | Offline RL     | Must be absent; experience columns in `rlColumns` | Hold-out of transitions (whole episodes when present) | meanReward, meanQ, tdErrorMean, tdErrorStd + actions |

`classification`, `regression`, `semi_supervised`, `clustering`, and `anomaly_detection` are implemented (Phases 9–10 delivered the semi-supervised and unsupervised extensions). `reinforcement_learning` is specified here and delivered in Phase 11; it follows the same upload, job, poll, and export contracts.

## Dataset Upload

| ID     | Requirement                                                                                       | Priority |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| FR-001 | The system shall accept a CSV file upload with a header row.                                      | Must     |
| FR-002 | The system shall reject files that are empty, lack a header, or exceed the documented size limit. | Must     |
| FR-003 | The system shall persist the uploaded bytes on the artefact volume under a generated identifier.  | Must     |
| FR-004 | The system shall compute a SHA-256 content hash of the uploaded file.                             | Must     |
| FR-005 | The system shall infer column names and sample dtypes from the header and first N rows.           | Must     |
| FR-006 | The system shall return a `datasetId`, hash, column preview, row count estimate, and `createdAt`. | Must     |
| FR-007 | The system shall reject an upload whose declared content type or file extension is not a CSV, or whose bytes do not sniff as text CSV. | Must     |
| FR-008 | The system shall reject a CSV whose header is missing, empty, contains empty column names, or contains duplicate column names. | Must     |
| FR-009 | The system shall reject a CSV that is not decodable as UTF-8 (a UTF-8 BOM is permitted). | Must     |

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Upload endpoint: `POST /api/v1/datasets` (`multipart/form-data`, field `file`).
- On success, returns `201 Created` with `{ datasetId, sha256, filename, byteSize, columns[], rowCount, createdAt }`.
- On empty or invalid CSV, returns `400 Bad Request` with `VALIDATION_ERROR`.
- On oversized file, returns `413 Payload Too Large` with `UPLOAD_TOO_LARGE`.
- On a non-CSV extension, a non-CSV content type, or bytes that sniff as a binary format (ZIP, gzip, PNG, PDF, ELF), returns `400 UNSUPPORTED_FILE_TYPE`.
- On a file that cannot be parsed as delimited text, returns `400 MALFORMED_CSV`.
- On a header with empty or duplicate column names, returns `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` with `details.field = "columns"`.
- On bytes that are not valid UTF-8, returns `400 MALFORMED_CSV`.
- Stored path is never taken from the original filename; original name is metadata only.

**Rationale:** Upload is the entry point. Hashing enables reuse detection and reproducibility. Generated paths prevent traversal. Content-type and magic-byte validation stops a mislabelled binary from reaching the parser, which keeps the upload surface honest about what it accepts.

## Column Mapping

| ID     | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                     | Priority |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| FR-010 | The system shall allow the user to select one or more feature columns as **X**. For `reinforcement_learning`, X are state features and experience columns are declared separately via `rlColumns`. | Must     |
| FR-011 | The system shall require exactly one label column as **Y** for classification, regression, and semi-supervised jobs, and shall reject a label column for clustering, anomaly-detection, and reinforcement-learning jobs. | Must     |
| FR-012 | The system shall reject mappings where Y is also included in X.                                                                                                                                 | Must     |
| FR-013 | The system shall reject unknown column names (not present in the dataset header).                                                                                                               | Must     |
| FR-014 | The system shall persist the mapping with the subsequent training job. For `reinforcement_learning`, `rlColumns` must also be persisted and validated. | Must     |
| FR-015 | The system shall require Y to be numeric for regression, categorical or discrete for classification and semi-supervised, and absent for unsupervised and reinforcement-learning tasks.         | Must     |

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Mapping is submitted with `POST /api/v1/jobs` as `{ datasetId, featureColumns, labelColumn?, taskType, algorithmId, ... }`. For `reinforcement_learning`, submit `rlColumns` and omit `labelColumn`.
- Invalid mapping returns `400` with `INVALID_COLUMN_MAP` and field-level details.
- A missing Y for a label-required task, or a supplied Y for an unsupervised task, returns `400` with `INVALID_COLUMN_MAP`. For `reinforcement_learning`, missing `rlColumns` or a supplied `labelColumn` returns `400` with `INVALID_COLUMN_MAP`.
- Regression with a non-numeric Y returns `400` with `INVALID_LABEL_TYPE`.
- Semi-supervised jobs that do not meet the labelled-row minimum return `400` with `INSUFFICIENT_LABELS`.

**Rationale:** Explicit X/Y mapping avoids silent wrong-target training.

| FR-026 | The system shall apply documented default hyperparameters when the client omits `hyperparameters`.                        | Must     |
| FR-027 | The system shall reject hyperparameter values outside the documented range with `INVALID_HYPERPARAMETERS`.                | Must     |

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Catalogue endpoint: `GET /api/v1/algorithms`, optionally filtered by any of the six `taskType` values.
- Each entry: `{ algorithmId, taskType, family, defaultHyperparameters, exports[] }` where `exports` always includes `onnx`.
- Unknown or mismatched algorithm returns `400` with `UNKNOWN_ALGORITHM` or `TASK_ALGORITHM_MISMATCH`.
- Out-of-range hyperparameters return `400` with `INVALID_HYPERPARAMETERS`.

**P0 sklearn catalogue (minimum):**

| algorithmId                    | taskType       |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- |

**P0 semi-supervised catalogue (Phase 9):**

| algorithmId                | taskType          | Estimator                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `self_training_classifier` | `semi_supervised` | `SelfTrainingClassifier(estimator=LogisticRegression(...))` |

**P0 unsupervised catalogue (Phase 10):**

| ------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fitted_q_iteration` | `reinforcement_learning` | `GradientBoostingRegressor` Q-function (Fitted Q-Iteration) |

**P1 neural nets (FR-023):** `mlp_classifier` and `mlp_regressor` are scikit-learn
`MLPClassifier` / `MLPRegressor` models whose architecture is configurable through
hyperparameters (see [`models.md`](../08-tech-stack/backend/models.md#neural-networks-p1)).
They are tabular multi-layer perceptrons.

**ONNX exclusions:** DBSCAN, AgglomerativeClustering, LabelSpreading, and LabelPropagation have no verified `skl2onnx` converter with the pinned stack and are therefore not in the catalogue.

## Training Jobs

| ID     | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                             | Priority |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| FR-030 | The system shall create a training job from a dataset, mapping, task type, and algorithm.                                                                                               | Must     |
| FR-031 | The system shall return `202 Accepted` with `jobId` and status `queued` without blocking on fit.                                                                                        | Must     |
| FR-032 | The system shall run validation, fit, evaluation, and export on a worker process.                                                                                                       | Must     |
| FR-033 | Job status shall progress through `queued`, `validating`, `training`, `evaluating`, `exporting`, then `completed` or `failed`.                                                          | Must     |
| FR-034 | The system shall split data for evaluation using a documented ratio and seed (default 0.2, seed 42); semi-supervised jobs split labelled rows only, unsupervised jobs do not split, and reinforcement-learning jobs split by episode (or by transition when no episode column exists). | Must     |
| FR-035 | Classification jobs shall return accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 (macro).                                                                                                           | Must     |
| FR-036 | Regression jobs shall return rmse, mae, and r2.                                                                                                                                         | Must     |
| FR-037 | The system shall persist library versions used for the job.                                                                                                                             | Must     |
| FR-038 | The system shall expose `GET /api/v1/jobs/{jobId}` for polling.                                                                                                                         | Must     |
| FR-039 | Failed jobs shall store a stable error code and a human-readable message (no stack traces in the UI).                                                                                   | Must     |
| FR-040 | The system shall reject a second mutation of a terminal job (no restart-in-place).                                                                                                      | Must     |

**Acceptance criteria:**

- `POST /api/v1/jobs` returns `{ jobId, status: "queued", datasetId, algorithmId, createdAt }`.
- Polling returns current `status`, optional `metrics`, optional `artefacts`, optional `error`.
- Terminal states: `completed`, `failed`.
- Duplicate create of a _new_ job is allowed (training is not idempotent on payload); clients may send `Idempotency-Key` to avoid double-submit from the UI.

**Rationale:** Fit can take seconds to minutes. Polling matches the local-only topology without introducing Kafka.

## Semi-Supervised Learning

| ID     | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                | Priority |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| FR-080 | The system shall support `taskType = semi_supervised` for classification with partially labelled data.                                                                     | Must     |
| FR-081 | A semi-supervised job shall require a label column; empty, whitespace-only, `NaN`, or `null` label cells denote unlabelled rows.                                           | Must     |
| FR-082 | A semi-supervised job shall require at least two labelled classes, at least 10 labelled rows, and at least 2 labelled rows per class; otherwise `400 INSUFFICIENT_LABELS`. | Must     |
| FR-083 | The system shall include all unlabelled rows in training features while excluding them from evaluation.                                                                    | Must     |
| FR-084 | Evaluation shall use a stratified hold-out of labelled rows only and return accuracy, precisionMacro, recallMacro, f1Macro, labelledRows, unlabelledRows, and iterations.  | Must     |
| FR-085 | ONNX export shall contain the fitted self-training base estimator and predict the original class labels; ONNX predictions shall match the fitted wrapper.                  | Must     |
| FR-086 | The system shall not require a label for excluded rows and shall not score unlabelled rows during evaluation.                                                              | Must     |

**Acceptance criteria:**

- `POST /api/v1/jobs` accepts `{ taskType: "semi_supervised", algorithmId: "self_training_classifier", labelColumn }`.
- Blank label cells are treated as unlabelled and are never included in the evaluation set.
- A CSV with fewer than 10 labelled rows, one class, or a class with one labelled row returns `400 INSUFFICIENT_LABELS`.
- A completed job returns the classification metric set plus `labelledRows`, `unlabelledRows`, and `iterations`.
- A CSV with no blank labels is valid and behaves as supervised training.

**Rationale:** Self-training improves a classifier when labels are expensive but unlabelled rows are available. Exporting the fitted base estimator preserves inference semantics because self-training only changes the training labels.

- Completed jobs return the documented clustering metrics and an `onnx` artefact.
- ONNX output labels match sklearn for every clustering algorithm.

**Rationale:** Clustering is the natural first unsupervised workflow on tabular CSVs and all three estimators have verified ONNX support.

## Anomaly Detection

| ID     | Requirement                                                                                                                                                     | Priority |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| FR-100 | The system shall support `taskType = anomaly_detection`; an anomaly-detection job shall not accept a label column.                                              | Must     |

| FR-104 | Anomaly-detection jobs shall return anomalyCount, anomalyRate, scoreMean, and scoreStd; scores are `decision_function` values where lower means more anomalous. | Must     |
| FR-105 | ONNX export shall be required; output labels (`1` inlier, `-1` outlier) and scores shall match sklearn.                                                         | Must     |

## Reinforcement Learning

| ID     | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Priority |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| FR-110 | The system shall support `taskType = reinforcement_learning`; a reinforcement-learning job shall not accept a label column and shall require an `rlColumns` object.                                                 | Must     |
| FR-111 | `rlColumns` shall declare `actionColumn` and `rewardColumn`, plus either `nextStateColumns` (mirroring `featureColumns`) or `episodeColumn`, and optionally `doneColumn`; experience columns must exist in the header, must not overlap `featureColumns`, and the action must be discrete (2–50 distinct values) with a numeric reward; violations return `INVALID_COLUMN_MAP` or `INVALID_LABEL_TYPE`. | Must     |
| FR-112 | The reinforcement-learning catalogue shall include `fitted_q_iteration`; `n_iterations` (1..50), `gamma` (0..1), `max_depth` (1..20), and `learning_rate` ((0,1]) shall default to 10, 0.9, 3, and 0.1, and out-of-range values return `INVALID_HYPERPARAMETERS`.                    | Must     |
| FR-113 | A reinforcement-learning job shall resolve transitions (explicit next state, or the next row within an episode), split by episode when an episode column exists and by transition otherwise, and fit the Q-function with Fitted Q-Iteration on the training side only.                | Must     |
| FR-114 | Reinforcement-learning jobs shall return `meanReward`, `meanQ`, `tdErrorMean`, `tdErrorStd`, and `actions`, plus `episodeCount` and `meanEpisodeReturn` when an episode column was declared; `tdErrorMean` is the mean absolute Bellman residual on the evaluation side of the split. | Must     |
| FR-115 | ONNX export shall be required and shall contain the fitted preprocessor + Q-function regressor taking the state features followed by a one-hot action block; ONNX Q-values shall match sklearn.                                                                                     | Must     |

**Acceptance criteria:**

- `POST /api/v1/jobs` accepts `{ taskType: "reinforcement_learning", algorithmId: "fitted_q_iteration", featureColumns, rlColumns }` with no `labelColumn`.
- A supplied `labelColumn`, a missing `rlColumns`, an experience column absent from the header or shared with `featureColumns`, or neither `nextStateColumns` nor `episodeColumn` returns `400 INVALID_COLUMN_MAP`.
- A non-numeric reward returns `400 INVALID_LABEL_TYPE`.
- Fewer than 10 transitions, fewer than two episodes with an episode column, or a hyperparameter outside its documented range returns `400 INVALID_HYPERPARAMETERS`.
- A completed job returns the documented RL metrics (including `actions`) and an `onnx` artefact whose Q-values match sklearn.
- The split never places both sides of a transition pair across train/hold-out when episodes are declared: whole episodes go to one side.

**Rationale:** Offline (batch) reinforcement learning from a logged experience CSV fits the CSV → train → ONNX philosophy: the Q-function is a scikit-learn regressor, so the existing preprocessor, split, allow-list, and export pipeline apply unchanged and no RL framework dependency is introduced. The policy (`argmax` over the recorded action set) is a documented consumer-side rule over the exported Q-function.

| FR-054 | The artefact `format` domain is `onnx`, `pkl`, `joblib`. | Should   |
| FR-055 | `GET /api/v1/jobs/{jobId}/artefacts/{artefactId}` shall stream the file as an attachment.       | Must     |
| FR-056 | Artefact download for a missing or failed job shall return `404`.                               | Must     |
| FR-057 | The system shall never expose filesystem paths in API responses; only artefact ids and formats. | Must     |

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Completed job payload lists artefacts as `{ artefactId, format, filename, byteSize }`.
- `format` is one of `onnx`, `pkl`, `joblib`.
- ONNX is present whenever `status = completed`.
- Optional formats are omitted (not null placeholders) when not produced.

| FR-178 | The wizard shall restore its in-progress state after a page reload and shall clear it when a job is accepted.     | Must     |

**Acceptance criteria:**

- A `GET` that fails with a network error is retried; a `GET` that returns `400` is not.
- Clicking the wizard's primary action on an invalid step moves focus to the first invalid field.
- Every error code in the catalogue renders a distinct, actionable message.

| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| FR-190 | The backend shall serve an interactive API reference at `/docs` and `/redoc`, and the raw schema at `/openapi.json`. | Must     |
| FR-191 | The committed `docs/06-api-specification/backend/openapi.yaml` shall be regenerated from the code and checked for drift in CI. | Must     |
| FR-192 | The interactive reference and the committed schema shall be linked from the product documentation and from the application. | Must     |
| FR-193 | Interactive documentation shall be disableable via `skl_ENABLE_INTERACTIVE_DOCS`.                | Should   |
