# scikit-learn-client (skl) — Features

## 1. Purpose

This document describes how skl features should behave from the user's perspective and how their behaviour should be implemented.

It complements:

- `00-overview.md` — product vision and scope.
- `01-requirements.md` — functional and non-functional requirements.
- `03-user-stories.md` — user goals and acceptance scenarios.
- `04-architecture.md` — system boundaries and technical responsibilities.
- `05-data-model.md` — entities, relationships, and constraints.
- `06-api-specification.md` — REST endpoints and request/response models.
- `08-tech-stack.md` — technology choices and rationale.
- `07-ui-ux-design.md` — interface and interaction design.

Features should be delivered in vertical slices: a user should complete CSV upload → mapping → train → ONNX download through the frontend, API, database, and worker before the next major workflow is started.

The canonical entities are `datasets`, `dataset_insights`, `jobs`, `job_metrics`, and `artefacts`.

skl is a software demonstration. It does not provide production AutoML or safety-critical guarantees. The reinforcement-learning extension (Phase 11) fits the same local-only constraints. The Phase 12 features (FEATURE-13..FEATURE-18) harden the platform and add discovery, comparison, and insight features on top of the same workflow.

Each feature section states **user-visible behaviour**, **inputs**, **outputs**, **states**, **edge cases**, and **acceptance conditions**. Priority maps to P0–P1 and to `FR-` identifiers.

## 2. Feature Priorities

| Priority | Meaning                          | Product stage                 |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| P0       | Required for the committed scope | Core platform and Phases 9–11 |
| P1       | Important for a complete studio  | Enhancement                   |

## 3. Feature Completion Definition

A feature is complete when: behaviour documented, FE/BE implement the contract, validation/failure handled, tests pass, migrations added, logs adequate, docs updated, quality gates pass.

## 4. MVP Definition of Done

MVP ready when the core workflow works end-to-end: upload CSV → map X/Y → choose sklearn model → train asynchronously → view metrics → download `.onnx`. Error handling complete, UI states implemented, health checks in place.

The semi-supervised and unsupervised extensions (FEATURE-09 and FEATURE-10) reuse the same workflow with a conditional label column and task-specific metrics. They are delivered in Phases 9–10. FEATURE-11 (reinforcement learning) reuses the same workflow with experience columns instead of a label; it is delivered in Phase 11.
